# TODO:
- [ ] 3. Summary (your goal, wishes, reveal what is important for you, what do you want and why.
Some kind of self-presentation. In case of lack of experience  Junior Developer sells his/her potential, his/her passion and ability to learn fast. You shouldn't think that everybody is going to teach you when you come to the workplace . Rather being a Junior means always learning new things from everywhere etc.).
- [ ] 4. Skills (e.g. programming languages, frameworks, methodologies, version control, tools etc.)
- [ ] 5. Code examples (LATEST)
- [ ] 6. Experience (for a Junior Dev it means all kinds of experience: coding tests, projects from courses, freelance projects - wherever they had the opportunity to demonstrate skills they have. Also it would be awesome if you add links to source code)
- [ ] 7. Education (including courses, seminars, lectures, online learning)
